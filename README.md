Blackjack Project - written for 2nd year project - Procedural Programming
Written by Sarah O'Connor using C.

The purpose of this application is to simulate a game of Blackjack. 
The player can choose to load an existing game, or start fresh. 
The player can also decide how many decks of cards to use, and how many players will play.

At any point during their turn, a player may check the game status, continue their turn, save the game, or quit the game without saving.


If I were to continue the development of this project, some additions I would make include:
  - Preventing same card being picked
  - 'Split' functionality - player may split their hand into two if holding a pair etc.
  - Improving 'save game' functionality - recording cards which have been picked
